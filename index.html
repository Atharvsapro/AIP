        <p>"Fruits and vegetables contain many vitamins and minerals that are good for your health.<br>
             These include vitamins A (beta-carotene), C and E, magnesium, zinc, phosphorous and folic acid. <br>
             They are low in fat, salt and sugar. They are a good source of dietary fibre.<br>
             Vegetables and fruit contain phytochemicals, or plant chemicals. <br>
             These biologically active substances can help to protect you from some diseases.<br>
             Vegetables and fruit are a handy snack food and are easily carried to work or school. <br>
              Fruits contain seeds which can lead to a new plant<br>

        <h2>Paper</h2>

        <p>We use paper every day for so many things that we don’t even think about a world without it. We get a newspaper delivered that tells us what is going on in the world. Napkins, paper towels, and even toilet paper are essential to our everyday lives!<br>
            To make paper from trees, the raw wood has to be turned into pulp. This pulp is made up of wood fibers and chemicals that are mixed together<br>
            The pulp is sprayed onto large mesh screens. This creates a mat of pulp that then goes through several processes to have the water removed and is dried out to become paper.

        <h2>Wax</h2>

        <p>Waxes such as paraffin wax or beeswax, and hard fats such as tallow are used to make candles, used for lighting and decoration.<br>
            There are many ways from which we get wax , such as <br>
            Beeswax - produced by honey bees<br>
            Soy wax - from soybean oil<br>
            And many more....

        <h2>Honey</h2>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558642452-9d2a7deb7f62?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=750&q=80"><br>
        <p>Honey is made by bees . As she sucks the nectar from the flower, it is stored in her special honey stomach ready to be transferred to the honey-making bees in the hive. <br>
            When her nectar “sacs” are full, the honeybee returns to the hive. Nectar is delivered to one of the indoor bees and is then passed mouth-to-mouth from bee to bee until its moisture content is reduced<br>
            Finally, the honey is placed in storage cells and capped with beeswax in readiness for the arrival of newborn baby bees.<br>

        <h2>Rubber</h2>
        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1527266258038-6ae3e089a609?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=667&q=80"><br>
        <p>Rubber is extracted by method called tapping, by making incisions into the bark and collecting the fluid into vessels attached to the rubber trees. The liquid is a sticky, milky sap called latex<br>
            Once the latex is collected from the plantation, is rushed to the processing plant<br>
            The latex is heated and mixed with acid ammonia which forms rubber like curds.<br>
            The sheets of natural rubber that are formed are cut and stacked ready for shipment to rubber molders
